                <p>Welcome to your local weather data analysis centre! Here you can submit your readings and create new
                    weather stations.
                    Also discuss about all weather related topics</p>
                <p>Weather stations for home use are getting more feature-rich and accurate all the time. There's plenty
                    of websites
                    that provide weather reports, but having your own digital weather station provides you with
                    real-time information
                    for right outside (and inside!) your house.
                    Whether you want a home weather station for your garden, planning outdoor activities, or simply to
                    know what to
                    wear outdoors; we are the Irelands largest weather instrument specialist.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to monitor, analyse and predict Irelandâ€™s weather and climate, and to provide a range
                    of high
                    quality meteorological and related information to our customers.
                <p><em>Our Vision - Making Ireland Weather and Climate Prepared.</em></p>
